# 3D-dataset-for-mathematical-modelling
These datasets are different in environment size, the number of obstacles, start location, and destination.
The obstacles are randomly placed in the area.
There are five test case. For each test case we have four different versions (Test case i-j)
which differ in number of obstacles, the start position and the destination. The obstacle matrix shows the altitude 
of each obstacle in a grid space.
Test case 1: 50X50 
Test case 2: 100X100
Test case 3: 150X150
Test case 4: 200X200
Test case 5: 250X250
